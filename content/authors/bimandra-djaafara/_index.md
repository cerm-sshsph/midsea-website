# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "My name is Bimandra Djaafara (Andra), and I am a PhD student studying infectious disease epidemiology at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, supervised by Dr Patrick Walker, Prof Thomas Churcher, and Dr Ellie Sherrard-Smith. With a background in epidemiology and statistics, I am passionate about utilising my skills to make a positive impact on global health outcomes. My current research focuses on utilising disease surveillance data and various modelling techniques (statistical and mathematical) to inform infectious disease control programs in Indonesia, with a particular emphasis on malaria and COVID-19."
