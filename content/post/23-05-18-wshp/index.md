On behalf of the National University of Singapore (NUS), we are pleased to host the workshop conducted by the Modelling Infectious Disease for South East Asia (MIDSEA) to our Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, from 8 to 12 May 2023. This workshop has been co-funded by Temasek Foundation (TF) and NUS.
During the visit, we will discuss "Modelling During A Public Health Emergency‚Äù. The workshop will be a mix of research talks, panel sessions and training sessions. We expect to have 40 participants from the region. We will focus on the challenges and advances made by various modelling communities in the area during the pandemic. We will also discuss the challenges faced by the region in the future and how we can work together to address them.
