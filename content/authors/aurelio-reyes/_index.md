Dr. de los Reyes held position as a senior researcher at the Biomedical Mathematics group within the Institute for Basic Science in Daejeon, South Korea. His research encompasses a wide range of interests, including modeling biological systems at various scales, from molecular to population levels. He applies optimal control theory and chemical reaction network theory to investigate these systems. Notably, his modeling efforts encompass studying the dynamics of the cardiovascular-respiratory system, developing intervention measures to combat infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, and devising therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.
