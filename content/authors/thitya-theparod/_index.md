bio: "Thitiya Theparod is currently an assistant professor of statistics at Mahasarakham University, Thailand. She holds a PhD in statistics from Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. Her research encompasses various areas, including computational statistics, optimal control strategies, interference statistics, and predictive models in machine learning. One of her primary research interests lies in mathematical modelling for infectious diseases, ranging from deterministic compartmental models to stochastic models. Her work primarily focuses on modelling the early stages of an epidemic to estimate the final size, the probability of extinction, and the mean time to extinction. Furthermore, she has developed an interest in data science for epidemic data analysis."
