# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Angkana T. Huang, aka Hat, leverages her multidisciplinary experiences (industrial design, computer science, and biology) to understand factors that shape transmission of infectious pathogens, focusing on those that disproportionately affect under-resourced populations, and to develop suitable means to combat public health threats in these settings. At population scales, she studies how changes in demography and societal interactions impact the ecology and evolution of pathogens. At molecular scales, she works to uncover molecular mechanisms responsible for differences between closely related strains. In addition to advancing knowledge through complex mathematical models, she also works to expand the capabilities of local communities to improve their ability to address their own specific challenges."
