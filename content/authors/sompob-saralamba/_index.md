# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "As a research software engineer at the bustling Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, I play with numbers, write efficient code, and combat malaria and dengue â€“ all without a superhero cape! From mapping out villainous parasites in malaria patients to plotting dengue control tactics (think sneaky Wolbachia bacteria), my PhD and knack for mathematical modelling equip me for the mission. The goal? Outsmart diseases using the sharpest software and hardware tools."
