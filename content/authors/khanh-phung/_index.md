# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I joined Oxford University Clinical Research Unit at Ho Chi Minh City (OUCRU) after finishing my medical training in 2009. During 10 years working at OUCRU as a Biostatistician, I obtained a Ph.D. and acquired experience in developing and evaluating clinical prediction models and designing and
analyzing clinical research, including randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Since February 2020, I have started my work as a lecturer at the Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Public Health, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City (UMP). At the UMP, I worked with my colleagues to design and deliver undergraduate and postgraduate courses on Epidemiology and supervised undergraduate and postgraduate students. In 2021, I joined the expert group to support the Ho Chi Minh Center for Disease Control's efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City. I also continue my work at OUCRU as a collaborator on several ongoing projects on dengue and COVID-19 research."
