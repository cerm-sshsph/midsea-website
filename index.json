This workshop has been co-funded by Temasek Foundation (TF) and NUS. During the visit, we will discuss “Modelling During A Public Health Emergency”. The workshop will be a mix of research talks, panel sessions and training sessions. We expect to have 40 participants from the region. We will focus on the challenges and advances made by various modelling communities in the area during the pandemic. We will also discuss the challenges faced by the region in the future and how we can work together to address them.\n","date":1684108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684108800,"objectID":"e13e816b00ac90e528efd251cda3e800","permalink":"https://example.com/post/23-05-18-wshp/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-05-18-wshp/","section":"post","summary":"First in-person workshop of MIDSEA.\n","tags":null,"title":"Modelling During A Public Health Emergency","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1683536400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683536400,"objectID":"45120f30b67228fa34f43f699032240c","permalink":"https://example.com/event/wshp/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/wshp/","section":"event","summary":"Modelling During A Public Health Emergency","tags":[],"title":"MIDSEA Workshop","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1681869600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681869600,"objectID":"4c2fe8a86ec16a76830b026cb3c241cc","permalink":"https://example.com/event/ol6/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/ol6/","section":"event","summary":"Mechanisms increasing the age of dengue cases in Thailand","tags":[],"title":"MIDSEA Webinar Session 6","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://example.com/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://example.com/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"}]
