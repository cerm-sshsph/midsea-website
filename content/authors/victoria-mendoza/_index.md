# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Victoria May P. Mendoza is an associate professor at the Institute of Mathematics, University of the Philippines Diliman. Her research focuses on mathematical modeling and control of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, as well as neglected tropical diseases such as lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. She employs tools such as differential equations, optimal control theory, and optimization to study these diseases and develop strategies for their control. Additionally, her research interests include parameter estimation, neutral delay differential equations, and reaction diffusion equations applied to ecological models. For her PhD research, she explored how inflammation may affect vascular refilling during hemodialysis."
