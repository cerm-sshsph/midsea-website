Originally from Malaysia, his academic interests include, but are not limited to, clinical, epidemiological, and implementation research. All are linked by the common theme of generating evidence-based solutions to the most pressing health problems affecting under-served and under-resourced populations, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. As well as clinical practice, research, and teaching, Dr Chew has served in consultancy roles nationally and internationally, and is a keen science communicator. He is also particularly enthusiastic about healthcare leadership and management, medical education and training, and mentoring the next generation of clinical academics. "
